'''
Daily hours of clear sky
In a previous exercise, you analyzed the 'sky_condition' column to explore the difference in temperature on sunny days compared to overcast days. Recall that a 'sky_condition' of 'CLR' represents a sunny day. In this exercise, you will explore sunny days in greater detail. Specifically, you will use a box plot to visualize the fraction of days that are sunny.

The 'sky_condition' column is recorded hourly. Your job is to resample this column appropriately such that you can extract the number of sunny hours in a day and the number of total hours. Then, you can divide the number of sunny hours by the number of total hours, and generate a box plot of the resulting fraction.

As before, df_clean is available for you in the workspace.

Get the cases in df_clean where the sky is clear. That is, when 'sky_condition' equals 'CLR', assigning the result to is_sky_clear.
Resample is_sky_clear by day, assigning to resampled.

# Using df_clean, when is sky_condition 'CLR'?
is_sky_clear = df_clean['sky_condition'] == 'CLR'

# Resample is_sky_clear by day
resampled = is_sky_clear.resample('D')

# See the result
resampled

# From previous step
is_sky_clear = df_clean['sky_condition'] == 'CLR'
resampled = is_sky_clear.resample('D')

# Calculate the number of sunny hours per day
sunny_hours = resampled.sum()

# Calculate the number of measured hours per day
total_hours = resampled.count()

# Calculate the fraction of hours per day that were sunny
sunny_fraction = sunny_hours / total_hours

----

# From previous steps
is_sky_clear = df_clean['sky_condition'] == 'CLR'
resampled = is_sky_clear.resample('D')
sunny_hours = resampled.sum()
total_hours = resampled.count()
sunny_fraction = sunny_hours / total_hours

# Make a box plot of sunny_fraction
sunny_fraction.plot(kind='box')
plt.show()
